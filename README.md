# EEG Signal Processing using Muse headband and apply Machine Learning algorithms to make it more efficient
I will analyse EEG signals using Muse Headband

EEG signals stands for electroencephalogram signals which are electrical signals from the brain.Previously it was very difficult to capture these signals as we had to use a large number of electrodes(256 electrodes) around the brain and we also had to use electrode gel to bridge the gap between the brain and the electrodes. But now things have changed and people has designed headbands which has made life easy. Nowadays manufacturers have been able to create dry sensors which are efficient to capture brain signals with lower number of electrode making the product commercially viable.

The muse headband which I will be using is a device to process EEG signals and use only 5 electrodes to capture the brain waves. They are based on the 10-20 system which means the electrodes will either be at 10% or 20% apart from each other. The five electrodes are AF7, Fpz, AF8, TP9, TP10 where Fpz is the reference electrode and all others are active electrodes. The diagram below depicts what I have said.
